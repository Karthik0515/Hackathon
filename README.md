# Hackathon
Crowd Management
       With the help of our project, we can control the crowd in public areas like Temple, Malls etc.,
So we can prevent the people from collision in the particular region.

How it works.. 
       When the people enters inside gate there is one camera emitter present near the gate,that camera stream the footage to the server room,where the machine algorithum run to manage the crowd count.
       If the people crowd reached the maximum count the gate will be automatically closed.So the Human work and also prevent the collision
